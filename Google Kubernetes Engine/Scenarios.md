- Want an efficient, completely auto scaling GKE solution - Configure Horizontal Pod Auto-scaler for deployments and Cluster Auto-scaler for node pools
- Want to execute untrusted third-party code in Kubernetes Cluster - Create a new node pool with GKE Sandbox. Deploy untrusted code to Sandbox node pool
